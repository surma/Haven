# Haven Product Vision

## What Haven is

Haven is a **mobile gateway to computing resources** — SSH, VNC, RDP, SFTP, SMB, and a local PRoot Linux, all wrapped in one app with strong credential security. The core thesis: *your phone is a thin client to any machine, including itself.*

## Identity

The strongest identity Haven has is: **the open-source, privacy-first mobile workspace.** JuiceSSH is dead. Termius went proprietary. ConnectBot is unmaintained. Haven is the only active GPL terminal app with modern Compose UI, hardware key support, and a local Linux environment.

The GPL/privacy audience chooses Haven *because* it's open source. Every security feature reinforces this identity.

## Use cases

Three concentric circles, in priority order:

1. **Terminal via VPN to workstation** — SSH, session persistence (tmux/zellij), reliable reconnect. Running Claude Code, development tools, system administration.
2. **Remote graphical desktop** — VNC/RDP to remote machines or local PRoot Xfce.
3. **Local PRoot development** — portable Linux environment on the phone itself.

## Cohesion assessment

The feature set is mostly cohesive around "access any machine from your phone." Where it frays:

- **SMB and RDP** serve a Windows-centric user who probably isn't the GPL/privacy audience. They're maintenance weight on a small project.
- **Reticulum** is visionary but niche — mesh networking for a handful of users.
- **Five terminal transports** (SSH, Mosh, ET, Reticulum, Local) means every terminal feature must work across all five. The SessionManagerRegistry exists to manage this complexity.

## Development priorities

### 1. Terminal excellence (highest leverage)

This is what 90% of users spend 90% of their time in.

- **Split panes** — horizontal/vertical splits within a single screen. Running htop beside an editor, or watching logs while coding. Most impactful feature for power users.
- **Scrollback search** — Ctrl+Shift+F to search terminal history.
- **URL detection** — clickable URLs in terminal output.
- **Semantic shell integration** — OSC 133 prompt markers enable "copy last command output" and per-command navigation. The `getLastCommandOutput()` method already exists in termlib.

### 2. Workflow continuity (the mobile-specific problem)

The fundamental challenge of mobile work: connections drop, the OS kills the app, the screen rotates.

- **Workspace profiles** — "Work" auto-opens SSH tabs + port forwards + SFTP sidebar. One tap to resume full working context.
- **Network transition** — detect WiFi/cellular/VPN changes and reconnect proactively instead of waiting for TCP timeout.
- **Background keepalive resilience** — Android Doze mode and app standby break long SSH sessions. Document best practices (battery exemption) and add reconnect actions to the persistent notification.

### 3. PRoot as development environment (most differentiated)

No other Android app ships a full Linux userland. This is Haven's unique wedge.

- **Curated development stacks** — "Install Python" / "Install Node.js" / "Install Rust" one-tap setup. Pre-tested, pre-configured.
- **sshfs mounts** — mount remote filesystems inside PRoot so local tools can edit remote files transparently.
- **Storage management** — PRoot rootfs images grow. Show disk usage, offer cleanup, support external storage.
- **Friction-free transition** — make it easy to start in PRoot and graduate to remote when you need power.

### 4. Security as brand

- **Tor/SOCKS proxy support** — connect to onion services via SSH. The JSch proxy infrastructure is already there.
- **Per-profile biometric unlock** — high-security connections require biometric each time, not just at app launch.
- **Audit log** — surface the existing ConnectionLog entity in the UI for security-conscious users.

## What to defer

- **New protocols** — the current set is sufficient. Adding more spreads the maintenance budget thinner.
- **File editing** — building an editor inside Haven is a rabbit hole. Make PRoot's vim/nano work well and focus on file transfer.
- **Collaboration features** — shared sessions, screen sharing. Out of scope for a single-developer GPL project.
- **Tablet/ChromeOS optimization** — get the phone experience perfect first.

## Architectural direction

A public library succeeds not by having every book, but by having the right books, organized well, in a building that's pleasant to be in. Haven's "books" (protocols) are sufficient. The work now is in the "organization" (workflow continuity, workspaces) and the "building" (terminal polish, split panes, search). The PRoot environment is the maker space in the basement — unique, powerful, and the reason some people choose this library over any other.

**Deepen the terminal, connect the workflows, keep the security story clean.** Width is sufficient. Depth is the opportunity.
